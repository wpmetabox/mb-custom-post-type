**MB Custom Post Types & Custom Taxonomies** helps you to register and edit custom post types and custom taxonomies easily in WordPress by providing an easy-to-use UI in the admin area.

The plugin allows you to handle all post type's arguments and taxonomy's arguments such as menu labels, admin bar label, exclude from search, disable archive page, etc. just in minutes.

### Features

* Supports all arguments for creating custom taxonomies (like `register_taxonomy()`)
* Supports **live editing mode**, which auto fill in all necessary labels for you!
