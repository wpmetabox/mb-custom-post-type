Create and manage custom post types and custom taxonomies with an easy-to-use interface in WordPress.

== Description ==

**MB Custom Post Type** helps you to create and manage custom post types and custom taxonomies easily in WordPress by providing an easy-to-use interface in the admin area.

The plugin allows you to handle all post type's arguments and taxonomy's arguments such as menu labels, admin bar label, exclude from search, disable archive page, etc. just in minutes. You don't need to write custom PHP code to register custom post types anymore (using function `register_post_type()` and `register_taxonomy()`).

Using **MB Custom Post Type**, you will be able to craft the WordPress admin and turn it into a professional Content Management Systems.

**Note:** Since version 1.1.0 MB Custom Post Type has integrated [MB Custom Taxonomy](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mb-custom-taxonomy/) to create and manage custom taxonomies with similar interface.
